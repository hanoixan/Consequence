 * Consequence.js
 * 
 * Consequence is a Javascript library for side-effect programming. That is, setting states 
 * that, when satisfied at any time, result in the executing of the specified instructions.
 * 
 * In the traditional imperitive model, it is the responsibility of the programmer to
 * write constructs that regularly check whether state has been satisfied in order
 * to execute subsequent instructions. In the side-effect programming model, a binding
 * is made between the state which must be satisfied at some point in the future, and
 * the code which handles the affirmative and negative results of that state.
 * 
 * Consequence.js provides a method chain language for creating state clauses which are
 * bound to function handlers. The function handlers, by default, only fire when the state
 * clause's final result changes. This can be overridden with explicit methods set(), get(),
 * and change(). These cause the handlers to fire every time based on a Cq object's .v
 * member being written to, read from, and changed, respectively.
 *
 * E.g.,
 * 
 *   // Set variables
 *   var a = new Cq(0);
 *   var b = new Cq("apple");
 * 
 *   // Define binding
 *   var binding = a.eq(1).and(b.eq("apple")).bind( function() {
 *     // state satisfied, do something. This is the affirmative handler, which is required.
 *     window.alert("State satisfied!");
 *   }, function() {
 *     // state not satisfied, do nothing. This is the negative handler, which is optional.
 *   });
 *
 *   // Satisfy the state, causing the window the pop up.
 *   a.v = 1;
 * 
 *   // Cleanup
 *   binding.free();
 * 
 * The state clause's operators can also handle arbitrary numbers of operators.
 * 
 *   var binding = a.and(b).and(c).and(d).bind( function(){ ... } );
 * 
 * Of course, the following is more concise:
 * 
 *   var binding = a.and(b,c,d).bind( function(){ ... } );
 * 
 * Consequence.js attempts to be efficient about checking this state by only evaluating 
 * when a dependency Cq variable has been modified, and using short circuit logic when
 * possible.
 * 
 * This library can be used when a programmer would rather say "whenever some complex 
 * state set X happens, do Y, and let me not worry about when", instead of 
 * "whenever I can, check whether some complex state set X is happening and do Y".
 * Example domains where this could be useful are games state, UI, and event systems.
